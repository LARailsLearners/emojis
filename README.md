##### Choose a Version Manager Tool 

A Version Manager allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems. This means you can have multiple version of Ruby installed and choose when you want to use them from project to project.

[RVM](https://rvm.io/)
[RBENV](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

You don't have to do this but here's some information on using Gemsets.

#### Gemsets
[RVM Gemset Basics](https://rvm.io/gemsets/basics)   
RVM gives you compartmentalized independent ruby setups. This means that ruby, gems and irb are all separate and self-contained - from the system, and from each other.
